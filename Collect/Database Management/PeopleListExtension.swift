 Within this file are functions that manipulate the PeopleList entity.  This entity
 keeps track of the people who are associated with specific receipts.  The functions
 within this file are range from adding people to the PeopleList to modifying its
 attribues, all the way up to being able to delete and fetch either a single person
 or an entire PeopleList associated with a specific receipt
