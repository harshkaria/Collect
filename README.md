# Collect
### An iOS app that eliminates the calculator app for receipt splitting -  built using Swift

# Overview
Using the TagGun API, we built an app that allows for anyone to scan a receipt, add people to a group, send out divided costs to people in the group, and keep track of who's paid.

Data is stored on device, courtesy of Core Data.

To use, set your [TagGun](https://www.taggun.io/) API Key in AppDelegate.swift
